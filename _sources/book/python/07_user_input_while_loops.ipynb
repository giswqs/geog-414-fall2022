    "Most programs are written to solve an end user’s problem. To do so, you usually need to get some information from the user. For a simple example, let’s say someone wants to find out whether they’re old enough to vote. If you write a program to answer this question, you need to know the user’s age before you can provide an answer. The program will need to ask the user to enter, or input, their age; once the program has this input, it can compare it to the voting age to determine if the user is old enough and then report the result.\n",

    "In this chapter you learned how to use input() to allow users to provide their own information in your programs. You learned to work with both text and numerical input and how to use while loops to make your programs run as long as your users want them to. You saw several ways to control the flow of a while loop by setting an active flag, using the break statement, and using the continue statement. You learned how to use a while loop to move items from one list to another and how to remove all instances of a value from a list. You also learned how while loops can be used with dictionaries."
